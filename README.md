- Hi, I’m @lucia-koiwai
- I’m interested in archiving my activities for Lucia, a streamer in South Korea (I myself is not a streamer, and I do not have any relation more than merely being a fan of her).
- I’m currently learning C++ as a hobby for game programming (it's going to be a long trip).
- I also want to improve my Python and matlab skill.
